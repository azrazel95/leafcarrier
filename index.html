            <p>One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Alright, I'm ready. Yeah, who are you? You don't understand.

              What, what? Hey. Give me a hand, Lorenzo. Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. No, Biff, you leave her alone. Who, who?
              
              Right. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Calvin. Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music. Shit.
              
              Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Who are you? I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. What's a rerun? Marty, you made it.
              
              George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you? Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? Doc, she didn't even look at him. Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl. I said the keys are in here.
              
              I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. No, bastards. Marty, why are you so nervous? Look, you gotta listen to me.
              
              Yeah, exactly. Right, I got it. Well, bring her along. This concerns her too. Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
              
              And he could sleep in my room. I followed you. Without any sugar. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Who is that guy.</p>
